# reddit-comment-deleter
This script deletes your reddit history without using the reddit API.

# How to use:
1. Open your browser
2. Login to reddit
3. click your username
4. run the script, and then make sure that your browser is the active window
5. repeat steps 1-4 for each sorting method (hot, top, new, controversial)


# Troubleshooting:
If you are using dark mode, a different resolution, or a different zoom setting, you may need to take a screen shot of the "delete" and "yes" buttons and replace the images in the "images" folder.

The mouse will move to the center of the screen shot, so the center of your screen shot needs to be in the right position to make your mouse able to click on the buttons.
